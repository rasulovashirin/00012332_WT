## About the app

The website is designed for a veterinarian clinic. There are 6 pages on the website. There are a header, footer, and navigation on each page. The home page has a promo section, introducing the users to the website. Moreover, the are list of services, call-to-action forms, and some useful articles. The next page is "about us" which gives detailed information about the vet clinic. I have used different types of elements to construct the website, namely, header, footer, nav, ul, form, input, and many others. I have validated the form using JS and made the list dynamic with the help of JS. Additionally, all pages are responsive.

As an external source, normalization (CSS) was used for basic website styling.

I have hosted my code on GitHub and the website on Netlify.
